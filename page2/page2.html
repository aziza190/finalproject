                    <h3>What was the Assignment?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our black panther assignment, we had to create a wikipedia-like page for one of our favorite
                        movies, which we had to code in git pod and write content on certain events in the movie, as
                        well as about the cinematography in the movie.

                    <h3>What was the most fun part of the project?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Creating this black panther tribute page was my favorite part of the project Making buttons,
                        adding
                        links, adding images, working with layouts and many other things, being able to link image tags
                        and
                        tags from one project to another was an enjoyable experience for me
                    </p>

                    <h3>What was the toughest part of the project?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning the image source tags and the html prompt at the beginning of my internship and being
                        able
                        to save and push my work was the most challenging part of the project.

                <h3>Characteristic 1
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It was important to follow the bootstrap website and the code provided in the Google Meet lessons
                    with Joshua and the group to understand the code.

                <h3>Characteristic 2
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My second characteristic was following w3schools, since the website has lessons about coding and
                    helps me when I do not know how to format html in a particular way.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A third characteristic was following YouTube videos when struggling with a certain code

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>As part of the assignment, I designed the black panther project in html. It is one of my favorite movies that
        talks about the cinematography, the acting and the violence that took place in this movie. The project was
        successful for me because I was able to make content before I signed the website because if I hadn't made the
        content before I signed the website I would have been stuck. The last characteristic would be having a passion
        for each project, which makes it a bit exciting. Another character trait would be looking up designs for this
        project that I had to decide what I wanted. </p>
