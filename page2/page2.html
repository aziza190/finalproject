  <p>As part of the assignment, I designed the black panther project in html. It is one of my favorite movies that talks
    about the cinematography, the acting and the violence that took place in this movie. The project was successful for
    me because I was able to make content before I signed the website because if I hadn't made the content before I
    signed the website I would have been stuck. The last characteristic would be having a passion for each project,
    which makes it a bit exciting. Another character trait would be looking up designs for this project that I had to
    decide what I wanted. </p>
